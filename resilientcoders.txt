Notes

Client-side computers make requests to the server and the server responds with information, files that are .html, .css, .js, etc.

Server-side code: back-end development

Progressive Enhancement: HTML should be controlling a majority of the site, content/context-wise

Balance Rate: Loading a page must take less than 3 seconds, or companies lose millions. Content must load more quickly. Speed supersedes all. The balance rate equates to the amount of people leaving the site because of speed > 3 seconds.

As a client is making a request to the server, the first wire junction is the Internet Service Provider.
The second junction is the Domain Name Service (DNS), which provides an IP address.

Each fiber wire can transfer 53 terabytes per second for internet service.
